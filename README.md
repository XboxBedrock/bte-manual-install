# Manual installation
> The modpack installer is recommended over a manual installation, as a manual installation will be a bit harder to update in the future. However, you might be entirely unable to use the launcher, or you might want to install the modpack manually for other reasons, so we'll show you how to do it here. For a manual installation, you can either use MultiMC or install the mods manually using Forge.

### Using MultiMC
> If you don't have it already, install [MultiMC from their official website](https://multimc.org/). The installation instructions should be pretty similar to any other app. Once you've installed it, follow these instructions to set up the modpack.


1. If you've just installed MultiMC, set your account by clicking on Accounts in the top right corner. Click on the Add button and log in using your Mojang username and password.

2. Create a new profile by pressing Add Instance in the top left corner.

3. Go to the Import from zip tab and paste the following into the text box: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XboxBedrock/bte-manual-install/main/BuildTheEarth%20Pack%202.0.zip

4. Once that's done, click on Edit Instance and go to the Settings tab.

5. Tick the Memory box and use the arrows to change the maximum amount of RAM allocated. We recommend somewhere between 4 GB and 8 GB; make sure your system can afford it.

6. Launch the modpack by double-clicking its icon. You're done!


### Using Forge
> If you’ve never installed mods before, using Forge may be a little more difficult, but there’s a first time for everything! Please install Minecraft version 1.12.2 and [Forge for 1.12.2](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html) if you don’t have it already. Then, follow the instructions.

> Make sure you backup and delete any other pre-existing mods. As this overrides the mods in the mods folder

1. Download the modpack zip from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XboxBedrock/bte-manual-install/main/MPForge112.zip).

2. Extract it with your favorite app, like Windows’ built-in zip browser or macOS’ [The Unarchiver](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/the-unarchiver/id425424353) into the appropriate game folder:

        On Windows: %APPDATA%\.minecraft\mods

        On macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods

        On Linux: ~/.minecraft/mods

3. Open Minecraft, and select the Forge 1.12.2 profile, then click Play. You’re done!


### Creating a new world
> The world does not come with the forge manual modpack, as we don't want to mess with your save files, so follow this animated guide!
