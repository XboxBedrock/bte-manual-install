Manual installation
The modpack installer is recommended over a manual installation, as a manual installation will be a bit harder to update in the future. However, you might be entirely unable to use the launcher, or you might want to install the modpack manually for other reasons, so we'll show you how to do it here. For a manual installation, you can either use MultiMC or install the mods manually using Forge.

Using MultiMC
If you don't have it already, install MultiMC from their official website. The installation instructions should be pretty similar to any other app. Once you've installed it, follow these instructions to set up the modpack:

If you've just installed MultiMC, set your account by clicking on Accounts in the top right corner. Click on the Add button and log in using your Mojang username and password.

Create a new profile by pressing Add Instance in the top left corner.

Go to the Import from zip tab and paste the following into the text box:

Once that's done, click on Edit Instance and go to the Settings tab.

Tick the Memory box and use the arrows to change the maximum amount of RAM allocated. We recommend somewhere between 4 GB and 8 GB; make sure your system can afford it.

Launch the modpack by double-clicking its icon. You're done!
